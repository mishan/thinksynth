TODO before the Thinksynth alpha
--------------------------------
+ -> mostly finished
* -> unfinished
- -> not started

*HIGH PRIORITY*:
[
- make thinksynth RT-safe by making sure malloc() is not used in thSynth::Process
 - also make sure that we use mutexes correctly in thSynth; perhaps figure
 out a way to make it such that args can be modified without locking
]

* remove or fix (argify) obsolete DSPs
- better descriptions in debian/control
- make a spec file for RH based distros?

OS X port
---------
- CoreAudio MIDI backend.
- Test JACK output.
- Installation instructions. Getting it set up was a real bitch.
