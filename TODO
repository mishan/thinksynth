TODO before the Thinksynth alpha
--------------------------------
+ -> mostly finished
* -> unfinished
- -> not started

- better descriptions in debian/control
* remove or fix (argify) obsolete DSPs
- make a spec file for RH based distros?
- make thinksynth RT-safe by making sure malloc() is not used in thSynth::Process
