Commands will be issued to thinkd in the form of a small packet.  The Packet is
in two main sections.  First will be a null-terminated string
containing the command name.  The second portion is a series of
arguments, each with first the argument name, number of elements, and a string
of floats.  If the number of elements is set to 0, the data will be a
null-terminated char string.  Each command will be terminated by "\n".

First an example of the structure:

A command with two strings of floats as args, and one with a float and
an ascii string:

<Command>\0<Arg Name>\0(Number of Elements)(data 0)...(data n)<Arg Name>\0(Number of Elements)(data 0)...(data n)\n
<Command>\0<Arg Name>\0(Number of Elements)(data 0)...(data n)<Arg Name>\0(0)<Data String>\0\n

With things in <> as ascii strings and things in () raw numbers.

Here is an example of a line to make a new channel with a channel
name, path name to the dsp file, and amplitude:

<NewChan>\0<name>\0(0)myNewChan\0pathname\0(0)./dsp/test.dsp\0amp\0(1)(30)\n
