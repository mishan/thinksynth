Commands will be issued to thinkd in the form of a small packet.  The Packet is
in two main sections.  First will be a null-terminated string
containing the command name.  The second portion is a series of
arguments, each with first the argument name, number of elements, and a string
of floats.  If the number of elements is set to 0, the data will be a
null-terminated char string.  Each command will be terminated by "\n".

First an example of the structure:

A command with two strings of floats as args, and one with a float and
an ascii string:

<Command>(null)<Arg Name>(null)(Number of Elements)(data 0) ... (data n)<Arg
Name>(null)(Number of Elements)(data 0) ...(data n)<Newline>
<Command>(null)<Arg Name>(null)(Number of Elements)(data 0) ... (data
n)<Arg Name>(null)(0)<Data String>(null)<Newline>

With things in <> as ascii strings and things in () raw numbers.

Here is an example of a line to make a new channel with a channel
name, path name to the dsp file, and amplitude:

NewChan(null)name(null)(0)myNewChan(null)pathname(null)(0)./dsp/test.dsp(null)amp(null)(1)(30)
