.B thinksynth
[\fI\-d OUTPUT\fR] [\fI\-p PATH\fR] [\fI\-r RATE\fR] [\fI\-l WINDOW\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
thinksynth is a modular synthesizer that utilizes either JACK or ALSA for
audio output and ALSA for MIDI.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d\fR OUTPUT
This specifies the audio output module to use during your Thinksynth session.
Currently, `alsa' and `jack' are supported. The default output module to use is `@DEFAULT_OUTPUT@'.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR PATH
This specifies an alternate path to search in for plugin modules. By default,
it is `@plugin_path@'.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR RATE
This modifies the sample rate of the output; the default may vary depending on
which audio output module is used
.TP
\fB\-l\fR WINDOW
This modifies the window length, which is currently synonymous with audio buffer size, for audio output. Please note that at the time of writing of this manpage, thinksynth will not automatically match up the buffer size with JACK, so you must specify the correct buffer size on the command line.
