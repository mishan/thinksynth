SCRIPTS
=======

Currently there's only one script in this directory.

regargify.pl - If you get something like this when loading your plugin:

WARNING: Node shaper has registered 0 args.  It is probably doing things the old, slow way.  (/usr/lib/thinksynth/plugins/dist/saturate.so)

Pass your source file to regargify.pl, and assuming you mostly stuck to the
plugin template, it can convert your file to use the new scheme.
